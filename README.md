#owl

Open Whatever Library

A cross-platform library for useful tools that can be used in other projects. 

##Highlights

- Simple and pretty logging
- Filesystem helpers
- Lua integration
- Socket client/server
- Websocket server (server can be extended to other protocols as well)

##Dependencies

None. Yes you heard it, there are no dependencies. The idea behind owl is that there are supposed to be no dependencies apart from CMake (which technically is no necessity) and a C++11 compliant compiler. Of course there are system and compiler requirements but no external libraries.

###Supported systems

- [x] OS X Xcode
- [x] Linux GCC 
- [x] Linux Clang
- [ ] Windows Visual Studio  2013

##License

owl is MIT licensed for easy integration in any other project. Although I appreciate an acknowledgment if owl is used.
